#Portuguese Bank : To create a predictive model which will help the bank marketing team to know which customer will buy the product.

This dataset is about the direct phone call marketing campaigns, which aim to promote term deposits among existing customers, by a Portuguese banking institution from May 2008 to November 2010. 

The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset's result of past bank telemarketing campaign and perform machine learning algorithms for predicting valuable customers who will join a term deposit product. The dataset was taken from 2008 to 2013 and it had an imbalance data with the majority of negative result distribution. As the bank's data scientists, we decided to focus on minimizing False Negative Class.

Evaluation metric that we will use is Recall. Where we will minimize false negative class - where we predicted clients that will not open a term deposit, turns out they actually want to open a term deposit. As our objective is to have as many clients to open a term deposit, therefore increasing recall will decrease this type of error.
